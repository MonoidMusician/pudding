I don't like it, but apparently cabal is the new stack (/sarcasm), so... here we are

GHCup 0.1.50.2 (version probably doesn't matter, but use `ghcup tui` to install:)
  HLS 2.10.0.0 <~ seems to work?
  cabal 3.12.1.0 <~ important!
  GHC 9.8.4 (Dec 2024) <~ very important!
    base 4.19.2.0 (comes with GHC 9.8.4, nothing you need to do there, just thought it was important to note)

Run `cabal update` to fetch the latest package index

Then `cabal build` should work?

--------

When you add a new module, you need to add it to `pudding.cabal` (and its module name needs to match its file path)
