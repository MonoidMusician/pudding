I don't like it, but apparently cabal is the new stack (/sarcasm), so... here we are
  (okay actually Stack is being maintained again? ... too late, maybe)

GHCup 0.1.50.2 (version probably doesn't matter, but use `ghcup tui` to install:)
  HLS 2.10.0.0 <~ seems to work?
  cabal 3.12.1.0 <~ important!
  GHC 9.8.4 (Dec 2024) <~ very important!
    base 4.19.2.0 (comes with GHC 9.8.4, nothing you need to do there, just thought it was important to note)

Run `cabal update` to fetch the latest package index

Then `cabal build` should work?

This HLS error during startup seems benign, but it can also indicate a real error:

> Failed to find the GHC version of this Cabal project. Error when calling cabal exec -v0 -- ghc --print-libdir

--------

When you add a new module, you need to add it to `pudding.cabal`:
  its module name needs to match its file path

Probably need to run `cabal build` again before it will show up, and/or restart HLS

--------

HLS gripes

- If the file does not parse, HLS cannot auto add imports
- If you write a type without importing it, it will add a pseudo definition to the file which shadows anything you might want to import, sigh
- Duplicate auto imports??

--------

cabal test
Error: [Cabal-7043]
Cannot test the package pudding-0.1.0.0 because none of the components are available to build:
  the test suite 'pudding-test' is not available because the solver picked a plan that does not include the test suites, perhaps because no such plan exists.
To see the error message explaining the problems with such plans, force the solver to include the test suites for all packages, by adding the line 'tests: True' to the 'cabal.project.local' file.


^ saw this with an outdated package set that meant hedgehog did not solve.
a better way to see the error is with `cabal test --enable-tests`.
`cabal update` fixed it.
